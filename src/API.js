          question: `A car dealership sells 0, 1, or 2 luxury cars on any day. When selling a car, the dealer also tries to persuade the customer to buy an extended warranty for the car. Let X denote the number of luxury cars sold in a given day, and let Y denote the number of extended warranties sold.       What is the variance of X? Authorâ€™s note: Solve this problem two different ways; (1) using marginal probabilities and (2) directly.`,
